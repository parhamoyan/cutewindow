## Code Style and Quality

We maintain high code quality standards using several tools:

### Code Formatting

### Pre-commit Hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality:

```bash
# Run all hooks manually
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run specific hook
pre-commit run black --all-files
```

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    app = QApplication.instance()
    if app is None:
        app = QApplication([])
    yield app
    app.quit()

def test_qute_window_creation(app):
    window = QuteWindow()
    assert window is not None
    assert window.windowTitle() == ""

def test_qute_window_title(app):
    window = QuteWindow()
    window.setWindowTitle("Test Window")
    assert window.windowTitle() == "Test Window"
```
